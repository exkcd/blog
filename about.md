Hey, I'm Rey. I am currently studying computer science and philosophy at the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.

I am currently interested in full-stack development with an emphasis on frontend because backend makes my head hurt. I am also interested in artificial intelligence, and more specifically the large language models and how the bridge between linguistics interacts with machine learning.

**Things that pique my interest**: drawing (specifically hands), web development, UX/UI design, existentialism, why you put shampoo in first and then conditioner

**Things that I enjoy**: hiking, climbing, yoga, photography, math rock, playing guitar, pondering the meaning of life, taekwondo

## About this site

After contemplating the pros and cons of finally settling for a domain name, and figuring out what the heck "Ruby" was, I finally got a single no-frills blog. This site is:

- Built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) an open source static site generator
- Coded using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

You can take a peek at my GitHub over [here](https://github.com/exkcd) which I use to display my other coding projects such as my [macOS config files](https://github.com/exkcd/config).
